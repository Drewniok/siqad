# qsi-sim

Simulation Tool for QSi's dangling bonds. There are two proposed contributions:

	(1) A CAD tool to assist in designing arrangements of dangling bonds on the surface.
  
	(2) A set of physics tools for the simulations of these arrangements.



## Prerequisites

#### GUI

The GUI is currently written in C++ and uses the Qt5 framework. The Qt5 framework will need to be installed in order to compile the source:

(1) The latest Qt5 source can be installed from https://github.com/qt/qt5, see their README for build instructions.

(2) Alternatively, an installer for the latest stable framework can be obtained from https://www.qt.io/download/. Currently, all source code for the GUI can fall under the GNU LGPL v3 license so select "Open source distribution...". This may change in future.

Depending on your installation method, you may need to first install Qt5 dependencies. On debian systems, these can be installed as (build-essential, libfontconfig1, mesa-common-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev).

	
## Building

There is currently no installer binary so the tool must be built from source. Development has been done purely in Linux and there has been no modification made to the .pro file to account for any additional OS-specified linking/includes.

If you are going to load the source as a project in Qt Creator, make a copy of the .pro file before first compile to prevent including unnecessary formatting in the official version. When committing your code, move only the necessary changes into the official .pro file with comments as needed.


## Licensing

The open source version of Qt5 falls under the GNU LGPL v3 license, as does the GUI code. Qt5 includes some packages which include third-party content under different licenses. If these are used their specific licenses must be considered. Refer to http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/licenses-used-in-qt.html for a list of third-party licensed libraries.
