Each physics engine occupies its own subdirectory. For example:

./                                          Current directory
./example-engine                            Subdirectory of the physics engine
./example-engine/engine_description.xml     File that describes the properties of the physics engine
./example-engine/example-engine[.exe]       Engine binary, use .exe extension for Windows
