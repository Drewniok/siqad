WORK ON GHOSTING BEHAVIOUR

Problems:
	- cannot move draged object back to itself
	- should only allow snapping to valid ghost locations (all lattice sites)
	- color differently for valid ghosts
	- deep copy for copy/paste
	- copy group hierarchy
	- need a more useful way to determine object type

Steps
	- change object types
