SiQAD Documentation
===================

SiQAD (**Si**\ licon **Q**\ uantum **A**\ tomic **D**\ esigner) is a next-generation CAD tool that enables the design and simulation of silicon dangling bond (DB) circuits through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and a modular simulation back-end. The tool currently offers simulators that predict ground-state and dynamic electron configuration of given DB configurations, and electrostatics simulation given electrode layouts. Please read the `SiQAD publication on IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963859>`_ (open access) for a detailed introduction to the tool and simulators, and visit the `Walus Lab website <https://waluslab.ece.ubc.ca/siqad/>`_ for information about us and other projects that Walus Lab works on!
