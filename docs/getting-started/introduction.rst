Introduction
************

SiQAD is a computer-aided design tool which enables the rapid design and simulation of computational assemblies of atomic silicon quantum dots. SiQAD consists of several classes of simulation tools: ground state charge configuration finders, non-equilibrium charge dynamics simulators, and electrostatic potential landscape solvers for the exploration of field-driven modulation with electrodes. The SiQAD GUI is written in C++ with the `Qt cross-platform application framework <https://www.qt.io/>`_.

This introduction will be better polished in the future. For now, please refer to our `SiQAD publication <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963859>`_ on IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology for more information :cite:`Ng2020_siqad`. A great publication on the experimental work in DB logic can be found in :cite:`Huff2018_OR`.
